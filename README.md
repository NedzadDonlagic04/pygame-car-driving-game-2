# pygame-car-driving-game-2

In this project I will be making a car driving
game for a homework assignment. In the game
you will drive a car while avoiding obstacles
such as sand, oil, rocks while trying to keep
the car's health as full as possible, even
having he option to refill it with a gas
can item that can appear on the road.
